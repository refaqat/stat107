This is shown as the prior plot is a polynomial function while the second seems to be more of an exponential growth. After analysis of the plots I see that with a lower value of n, it becomes more likely to have at least two people share a birthday (which makes sense as it is an exponential)."

This makes sense as there is only really a 1% chance of being related to Taylor, regardless of testing. This also makes sense because genetic testing can arise in false positives when tests wrongly give a positive answer due to confounding factors during the testing. So the actual value of how many people are related to her depends on the number of false positives given. This is as I expected, because from the beginning I had to keep in mind the imperfections of genetic testing."
